## :information_source: About 

<h4 align="center">Based on the classic and popular game of the 80's</br>
Simon is a rhythmic electronic game invented in the United States,</br>
simple and addictive game designed to develop and exercise your memory,</br>
keep the mind sharp and alert.
</h4> 

In the Simon game there are four big buttons on the game console and each one has its own color:
red, yellow, green or blue, and under each button there is a light that is used to illuminate it.

The console randomly selects a certain button and lights it up.
When the button is illuminated, a sound unique to the button is also played.
The game starts when the console lights up any button.
The player has to press the button that the console showed him, with each additional turn adding another color (another button).
It is a form of learning through imitation.
The game ends when the player makes a mistake and presses a button that did not appear in the sequence, or when he succeeds in repeating the longest sequence defined.
